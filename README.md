# trpc-uwebsockets-example

Quite messy example, but it works. Subscriptions are working as intended

- Run the server with `pnpm start-server`
- Run node client with `pnpm run-node`
- Run web client with `pnpm run-browser`

In order for browser to work, go to `./react` and install dependencies `pnpm i`.
